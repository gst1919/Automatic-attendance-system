# Face-recognition-Attendance-System-Project
Final Year Face recognition Attendance System Project 


### Abstract 

The motivation behind this project was to help Students, to make it easier for 
them to record their attendance by not having to be dependent with Card systems, as Student cards are often lost and paid to replace. This means they 
cannot prove their identity and record attendance instantly. The card-system is also at fault often with inaccurate attendance recordings, as it can be tricked 
or fooled, when individuals are able to record attendance for others. In the event when card system is offline, paper-based system have to be used in this 
event. This makes more time consuming for students and makes it
harder for them to focus on the lecture/lab sessions.
